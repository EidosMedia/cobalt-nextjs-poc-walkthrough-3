# Next.js headless app with Cobalt example

## How to use

Download the example [or clone the repo](https://github.com/EidosMedia/cobalt-nextjs-poc):

Install it and run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```


## The idea behind the example

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), and shows how it is possible to integrate it with [Eidosmedia Cobalt](https://www.eidosmedia.com/platforms/#cobalt) headless APIs.
It also includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, in order to build a modern, responsive website - taking inspiration from the [Fortnightly](https://material.io/design/material-studies/fortnightly.html) MUI template.
